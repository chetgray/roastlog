# Roast Log

Roasting coffee generates a lot of data: temperatures, times, weights,
TDS readings, tasting notes. When this is recorded on paper,and left
unindexed, referencing and comparing the data is a significant pain
point, and the data cannot be fully leveraged to improve the roasting
process.

**Roast Log** intends to allow for easy search and display of this data.

## Code Louisville

**Roast Log**, in its initial front-end-only form, also serves as my
project for [Code Louisville's][Code Louisville] Front-End Web
Development course, Janâ€“Mar 2018. The `master` branch is live, served by
GitHub Pages at [http://www.chetgray.com/roastlog/][roastlog live].
To view locally, `git clone` [`chetgray/roastlog`][roastlog git] and
`git checkout master` or download and extract a
[zipped archive of the repository][master zip], and then open
`index.html` in your web browser.
