# Roast Log

Roasting coffee generates a lot of data: temperatures, times, weights,
TDS readings, tasting notes. When this is recorded on paper,and left
unindexed, referencing and comparing the data is a significant pain
point, and the data cannot be fully leveraged to improve the roasting
process.

**Roast Log** intends to allow for easy search and display of this data.
